# 🔗 API Endpoints

StudyMate AI uses Flask API endpoints to connect the frontend with the backend AI services.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/generate` | Handles summarization, concept explanation, and answer improvement |
| `POST` | `/api/quiz` | Generates AI-powered quizzes |
| `POST` | `/api/rag/upload` | Uploads and processes study documents |
| `POST` | `/api/rag/ask` | Answers questions using uploaded study material |

---

# 🤖 AI Integration

StudyMate AI uses **Google Gemini** as the primary AI model.

Gemini is used across multiple modules for:

- Summarizing study material
- Explaining concepts
- Improving written answers
- Generating quiz questions
- Generating answers from retrieved document content

The application uses different prompts depending on the selected module so that the AI response is focused on the student's specific requirement.

---

# 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The **Ask My Notes** module uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to make the AI response more relevant to the student's uploaded material.

Instead of simply asking the AI a question, the system first retrieves relevant information from the uploaded document and then uses that information to generate the response.

### RAG Process

# 🔐 Security & Validation

StudyMate AI follows basic security practices to protect API credentials and user input.

### Security

- Gemini API keys are stored in environment variables.
- `.env` is excluded from version control.
- API credentials are handled on the backend.
- API keys are not exposed directly in the frontend.

### Validation

The application performs validation for:

- Empty user input
- Invalid requests
- Unsupported document types
- File size limits
- Quiz generation responses
- Missing or invalid AI responses

These checks help provide a safer and more reliable user experience.

---

# 🔑 Environment Variables

StudyMate AI requires a Google Gemini API key.

Create a `.env` file in the project directory:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
GEMINI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=gemini-embedding-001
MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB=10
```

> **Important:** Never commit your `.env` file or expose your API key publicly.
